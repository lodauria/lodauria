### About me 👨🏻‍💻

I am **Lorenzo D’Auria**, born in **Trieste (Italy)** in **1997**. After the scientific high school qualification obtained in 2016, I have continued my studies at the **University of Trieste**. During my bachelor’s degree, I have learned the basics of engineering and during the third year, I have understood that **automation engineering** is the IT topic I am most interested in. Therefore for my thesis work, I have chosen to develop from scratch a self-balanced inverted pendulum using a reaction wheel.

Following my passions, I have then moved to Rome to study AI and Robotics at **Sapienza University**. The experience of living on my own made me grow from a personal point of view, while the more practical approach found at Sapienza allowed me to refine other important skills such as teamwork, self-reliance, organization, and English as well. For my master thesis, I have decided to work on the development of an innovative safe navigation algorithm for UAVs obtaining very satisfactory results.

During 2022, I worked for **Alten Italia** as a System Engineer. More specifically, I was a part of the **Leonardo Avionic Sensors Simulation team** in Ronchi dei Legionari (GO), Italy as an external consultant. I was involved in the development of real-time systems for flight simulators, and I mainly worked with Visual Studio, GitLab, and the Qt Framework.

I am currently employed at **Fincantieri** where I am part of the **Digital Innovation team** for the study and development of new solutions in the fields of Robotics, AI and IoT, with the goal of improving the shipyard efficiency and security. I mainly work with Python, C++, ROS, Azure, Git and Unix in general.
